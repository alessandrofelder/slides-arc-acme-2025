## Intro

- Original background in Computational Mechanics ⚙️
- Later experience in biological image processing 🔬
- Formerly, Senior RSE in "core" ARC
- Currently, Senior RSE in the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/about)
- (food, football, nature)

## Warning ⚠️

This is an experimental presentation!

Contents:

* A perspective on ARC-led research
* Explained with an example



# Perspective

## Observation

- ARC-led research is part of our mission
   - ARC fellows 
   - ARC academic directors
   - Seed funding mechanism
   - Alignment with subgroups

::: aside
This could (always) be better.
:::

## Requirements (I _think_)

- Be high-quality research in the traditional sense
  - novel, useful and impactful
- Avoid competing with UCL's existing research
- Align with dRTP values
  - open-source, recognition for technical contributions, sustainability, accessibility, ...
- Align with UCL & funding agencies' priorities
- Be fun

## Possible implementation approaches

- Research about the dRTP profession
- Research in our existing backgrounds
- **"Remixing" our backgrounds and experiences from existing collaboration projects to new applications**
  
::: aside
I think ARC is particularly well-placed for this.

# Background

## ARC people know a lot

Three pieces of open-source software that ARC knows about

* NekMesh is good at making meshes
* FEniCS is good at solving partial differential equations
* BrainGlobe is good at aligning images to a common space

## NekMesh

::: aside
A (volumetric) mesh is a discretization of a 3D object.

## FEniCS

## FEniCS solves equations on meshes

::: aside
Meshes should be "mathematically nice" so we can solve equations on them.
Meshing complex geometries like biological organs is hard and doesn't scale well.

## BrainGlobe is good at aligning images to a common space

## Annotate once, map annotations to many

## What if we could mesh only once?
Using the same image alignment approach

::: aside
This means building the mapping into the equations.

## A remixing example

* Take the idea mapping to atlas space from BrainGlobe
* Augment the idea with a atlas space volumetric mesh
* Solve PDEs for many samples on the atlas space mesh with FEniCS - scales well!
* (PDEs are not so interesting for brains, but they are for other organs, like bones!)


## Meets the Requirements (I _think_)

- Be high-quality research in the traditional sense
  - novel, useful and impactful
- Avoid competing with UCL's existing research
- Align with dRTP values
  - open-source, recognition for technical contributions, sustainability, accessibility, ...
- Align with UCL & funding agencies' priorities (?)
- Be fun

## Things I have left out

* in-depth numerical methods
* what this would look like in code
* grant writing tips I have gathered

## Discussion

Thank you!
