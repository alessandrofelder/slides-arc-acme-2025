## Intro

- Original background in Computational Mechanics
- Later experience in biological image processing
- Formerly, Senior RSE in "core" ARC
- Currently, Senior RSE in the [Neuroinformatics Unit](neuroinformatics.dev/about)
- (food, football, nature)

## Warning

This is an experimental presentation!
Contents:
* a perspective on ARC-led research
* explained with an example
* feat. Mashy Green and Matthew Scroggs.

::: aside
Thanks to Will Graham and Matt Graham.

# Perspective

## Observation

- ARC-led research is part of our mission
   - ARC fellows 
   - ARC academic directors
   - Seed funding mechanism
   - Alignment with subgroups

::: aside
This could (always) be better.
:::

## Requirements (I _think_)

- Be high-quality research in the traditional sense
  - novel, useful and impactful
- Avoid competing with UCL's existing research
- Align with dRTP values
  - open-source, recognition for technical contributions, sustainability, accessibility, ...
- Align with UCL & funding agencies' priorities
- Be fun

## Possible implementation approaches

- Research about the dRTP profession
- Research in our existing backgrounds
- **"Remixing" our backgrounds and experiences from existing collaboration projects to new applications**
  
## The "remixing" approach

- Take knowledge we learnt doing a collaboration project and apply it to a new domain
- Try to explain with a real-world example
- Give some background first

::: aside
I think ARC is particularly well-placed for this.

# Background

## ARC people know

Three pieces of open-source software that ARC knows about

* NekMesh is good at making meshes
* FEniCS is good at solving partial differential equations
* BrainGlobe is good at aligning images to a common space

## NekMesh

::: aside
A (volumetric) mesh is a discretization of a 3D object.

## FEniCS

## FEniCS solves equations on meshes

![](img/fenics-elasticity.png){ height=500px }

::: aside
Meshes should be "mathematically nice" so we can solve equations on them.
Meshing complex geometries like biological organs is hard and doesn't scale well.
:::


## BrainGlobe is good at aligning images to a common space

![](img/brain-atlas-mapping.png){ width=400px }

## Annotate once, map annotations to many

![](img/brain-atlas-mapping-with-annotations.png){ width=400px }

## What if we could mesh only once?
Using the same image alignment approach

::: aside
This means building the mapping into the equations.
:::

## A remixing example

* Take the idea mapping to atlas space from BrainGlobe
* Augment the idea with a atlas space volumetric mesh
* Solve PDEs for many samples on the atlas space mesh with FEniCS - scales well!
* (PDEs are not so interesting for brains, but they are for other organs, like bones!)


## Requirements (I _think_)

- Be high-quality research in the traditional sense
  - novel, useful and impactful
- Avoid competing with UCL's existing research
- Align with dRTP values
  - open-source, recognition for technical contributions, sustainability, accessibility, ...
- Align with UCL & funding agencies' priorities (?)
- Be fun

## Things I have left out

* in-depth numerical methods
* what this would look like in code

## Discussion

Thank you!






## Digital Research Technology Professionals

We support researchers across disciplines.

We see technologies from many fields.

We understand computational approaches broadly.

## Our Unique Position

We can see connections others miss.

Technologies from one discipline can solve problems in another.

We can mix and match approaches.

## Cross-Disciplinary Transfer

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**From Discipline A**
- Method X
- Tool Y
- Approach Z

::: {.column width="50%"}
**To Discipline B**
- New application
- Different problem
- Fresh perspective

TODO: Replace with actual example of technology transfer

## Concrete Example

::: {.callout-note}
## TODO: Add Your Example

Choose a specific case where:
- A technology/method from one field was applied to another
- Or multiple approaches were combined
- Show the impact or benefit
:::

## Example Structure {.smaller}

**Original Context:**
- TODO: Describe where the technology came from
- TODO: What problem it solved originally

**New Application:**
- TODO: Describe the new field/problem
- TODO: How it was adapted

**Outcome:**
- TODO: What was achieved
- TODO: Why it mattered

## Why This Matters

Research technologists bridge disciplines.

We enable innovation through technology transfer.

We accelerate discovery by connecting dots.

## Takeaways

- Research technologists have unique cross-disciplinary perspective
- Technologies can be transferred and adapted
- Mixing approaches creates new solutions
