## Intro

- Background in Computational Mechanics
- Experience in biological image processing
- Formerly, Senior RSE in "core" ARC
- Currently, Senior RSE in the [Neuroinformatics Unit](neuroinformatics.dev/about)

## Warning

This is an experimental presentation!

::: aside
I am interested in what you think, especially if you disagree.

## Observation

- ARC-led research is part of our mission
   - ARC fellows 
   - ARC academic directors
   - Seed funding mechanism
   - Alignment with subgroups

::: aside
This could (always) be better.

## Requirements (I _think_)

- Be high-quality research in the traditional sense
  - novel, useful and impactful
- Avoid competing with UCL's existing research
- Align with dRTP values
  - open-source, recognition for technical contributions, sustainability, accessibility, ...
- Align with UCL & funding agencies' priorities
- Be fun

## One possible solution

Obviously, as an RSE, I immediately want to design a general-purpose framework to meet these requirements!







## Digital Research Technology Professionals

We support researchers across disciplines.

We see technologies from many fields.

We understand computational approaches broadly.

## Our Unique Position

We can see connections others miss.

Technologies from one discipline can solve problems in another.

We can mix and match approaches.

## Cross-Disciplinary Transfer

**From Discipline A**
- Method X
- Tool Y
- Approach Z

::: {.column width="50%"}
**To Discipline B**
- New application
- Different problem
- Fresh perspective

## Concrete Example

::: {.callout-note}
## TODO: Add Your Example

Choose a specific case where:
- A technology/method from one field was applied to another
- Or multiple approaches were combined
- Show the impact or benefit

## Example Structure {.smaller}

**Original Context:**
- TODO: Describe where the technology came from
- TODO: What problem it solved originally

**New Application:**
- TODO: Describe the new field/problem
- TODO: How it was adapted

**Outcome:**
- TODO: What was achieved
- TODO: Why it mattered

## Why This Matters

Research technologists bridge disciplines.

We enable innovation through technology transfer.

We accelerate discovery by connecting dots.

## Takeaways

- Research technologists have unique cross-disciplinary perspective
- Technologies can be transferred and adapted
- Mixing approaches creates new solutions

This is how you create a references section, i.e. a bibliography.
